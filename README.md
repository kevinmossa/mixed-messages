# mixed-messages

This is a simple Javascript project that takes a *two* arrays and randomly concats them in order to create a *random* unique phrase. 

This is a very simple solution and not dynamic with more than 2 arrays since I hard coded the concatenation of the two arrays. However, you can edit the arrays to whatever you would like!
